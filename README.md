# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline built using the famous Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.
